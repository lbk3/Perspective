This repo contains my BEng Software Engineering honours project completed on May 2017 at Edinburgh Napier University.

<summary>The Application</summary>
A mobile application that I have developed for my honours project as part of my BEng Software Engineering degree at Edinburgh Napier University.
The application is centred around mental health coping strategies and social media. By helping to remove the stigma of mental health and providing such
materials in a platform as accessible as a mobile device, specifically Android for now, then I hope to create a new way to manage mental health.
